From the innermost sanctum of the Prime Minister's private offices among the Minaret-studded buildings of Putrajaya to streets filled with tear-gassed protestors in downtown Kuala Lumpur, Romen Bose, a former international correspondent and political communications consultant to then Prime Minister Najib Razak, provides a gripping and engaging true story of drama, intrigue, violence and incompetence that finally ended the rule of Malaysia's sixty-one year old Barisan Nasional Government in May 2018. With a front-row seat to the major controversies that hit the Najib Razak administration, Romen reveals for the first-time how the country's leadership reacted to the disappearance of MH370 and the still classified covert moves to retrieve the remains of Malaysian victims following the shooting down of MH17. 'Final Reckoning' also gives a blow-by-blow account of how the 1MDB scandal rocked the Government and the attempts by the country's top politicians and their advisers to contain and explain it away.
