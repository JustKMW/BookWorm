                    <span class="tooltip">A young woman must use her musical talents to uncover lost memories and Celestial secrets to save the Six Realms. With her loving uncle away traveling, orphaned Xue joined an entertainment house to hone her musical talents in playing the qín. Now, following years of service and learning, the 17-year-old has become an apprentice, and her uncle gifts her a new qín. Shortly after, he&apos;s killed by bandits, leaving her lonelier than ever. Throwing herself into her music, Xue captures the attention of handsome young nobleman Meng Jinglang, who offers to pay off her indenture contract in return for her playing music at his manor for one year. The offer grows more enticing when he reveals that he knew her uncle and needs her help completing an unfinished task of his. But as she spends time with Jinglang at Meng Manor, she uncovers many secrets. It turns out that Jinglang is the Celestial Realm&apos;s Duke of Dreams, and that the Six Realms are on the verge of ruin. Together, they must figure out the answers, which are somehow connected to her qín. Although this fantastical hero&apos;s journey has a slow start, it&apos;s full of magic, mystery, music, poetry, and intrigue. The detailed and impressive worldbuilding incorporates Chinese culture, food, lore, and poetry. A breakdown of the structure and order of the Six Realms, an author&apos;s note, and a glossary of Chinese characters, pronunciation, and definitions offer helpful context and background.</span>
